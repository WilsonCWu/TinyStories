prelim: 
* good data for training new model. don't see much about the model architecture other than hyperparameters, i guess this means i should use standard architecture
* Two datasets: tinystories and tinystories-instruct. looks like they're each meant to train a different model.
* tinystories easier to start with
* meant to run on a single machine.
trying it out

model sizing
* `We use GPT-Neo architecture with window size 256 and context length 512.` ??? arent those the same thing
* `Our results, shown in Figure 24, suggest that in the regime where the number of heads is small, increasing it improves the performance of the model across all metrics.` `To understand the modelâ€™s attention pattern after training, we use a 1-layer model with hidden dimension 1024 and 16 attention heads that was trained on TinyStories` ok let's start with head size 64
