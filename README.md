prelim: 
* good data for training new model. don't see much about the model architecture other than hyperparameters, i guess this means i should use standard architecture
* Two datasets: tinystories and tinystories-instruct. looks like they're each meant to train a different model.
* tinystories easier to start with
* meant to run on a single machine.
